Description:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
XWABHE is a BinHexEdit Module for the executable file 'xwingalliance.exe' of X-Wing Alliance (XWA).

If you own this excellent version of the awesome flight simulator produced by Lucasarts / Totally Games, you will be able to modify craft statistics so that you can add some more excitement to the game.

The disclaimers in the program apply to this project.  Use at your own risk.  This is meant to be used for researching additional characteristics, and is not final.  Some characteristics are missing and not yet deciphered!  So, slicers, get to it. If you're using this, this means you!
