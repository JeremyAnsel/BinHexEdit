At this present moment in time it will only let you use the Default icons set in the DAT files, as these cannot be changed as yet.

0 - No Icon
100 - X-Wing = slot 1
200 - Y-Wing = slot 2
300 - A-Wing = slot 3
400 - B-Wing = slot 4
500 - TIE Fighter = slot 5
600 - TIE Interceptor = slot 6

And so on until you come to slot 33 (First Reserved Fighter), these are set to 0 for the next 17 slots

If you have a Custom Craft in one of the reserved slots replace the 0 with a number ranging from 100 to 4600 (in the hundreds) i.e. an icon that resembles your custom craft).

3200 - Shuttle = slot 50
The next slot (50) for some reason LA/TG set the Escape Shuttle value as 0, but if one puts 3300 in place of the zero, the Escort Shuttle icon shows up in the HUD

3400 - Stormtrooper Transport = slot 52

And so again until slot 59 Millennium Falcon this value (4000) is set the same as the YT-1300 (slot 58), for obvious reasons.

4100 - YT-2400 (Outrider) = slot 60
to
4600 - YT-2000 (Otana) = slot 65

Slot 66 (First Reserved Shuttle)
to
Slot 71 (Container A) all set to 0
