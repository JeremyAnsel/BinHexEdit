Ok for those who have added custom missions
In single player mode you will know when you have reached
Battle 7 : Mission 4: Phase #4: Death Star Tunnel Run
You see the picture of the Falcon in the reactor core.

But if you have added custom missions these last pictures are repeated for how many custom missions you have added.

But not any longer

With these Byte's you can change the number of Battles and Missions you have added.
So with PalPatricks DATech you can add your own pictures.

So know adding new missions you will be able to add you own pictures to a Dat file.

So how does it work
-------------------
Well in the original TG Mission.lst you have 7 Battles and 52 Missions

So if the max MISSION_x in mission.lst is 52, you put 53 in Mission Number box and 53 the Mission Sticker Number box

If the max BATTLE_x in mission.lst is 7, put 8 in Battle Number Box.

I think you get the general idea

Battle 7 = 8
Mission 52 = 53

and so on

The original settings are

53 = mission number
53 = mission sticker number
8  = battle number

Ok for example your adding 2 more battles with 5 missions in each battle

It will look like this

10
63
63

10 = you have 9 Battles
63 = means you have 62 mission in the mission.lst text files

Note: If you change these numbers and you haven't added a new dat file with custom pictures, NO pictures will show ingame.
