The number in this slot plus one is which line to 
read OPT file description in the file assigned by 
OPTLocation 1.


For example, the 9th line in SPACECRAFT0.LST 
is \FLIGHTMODELS\TIEDEFENDER.OPT, so 
you would see 8 in this slot. If you replace 8 with 
11 in this slot, you would have a T/D disguised as 
Missile Boat. You can't fly it yet, because the 
hardpoint info does not match, you need to change a
lot of weapon info because T/D has 6 guns and 2 W/Hs
while MIS has only 1 gun but 4 W/Hs. But it's fun to 
see it in tech library and let you know how this slot 
works..:)

There are 154 & 159 lines in the original 
SPACECRAFT0.LST & EQUIPMENT0.LST
respectively. So, when adding OPTs, simply add 
\FLIGHTMODELS\YOURCRAFT.OPT 
after the lines already there, and input the 
numbmer starting 154 (159 for the other file) 
in this slot.
