These bytes let you edit the S-foil properties of the first 50 craft.  It's not as simple as you'd expect it to be.

This is NOT ALL of the S-foil information, you still cannot give craft other than the X-wing or B-wing fully working S-foils.  This is elsewhere in the EXE, and has yet to be found.

=====================================
"Has S-foils" Line:
These is the line that actually activates/deactivates the S-foils.  Here's what XWA has as default.

0 - X-wing
1 - B-wing
2 - Missile Boat
3 - Gunboat, Blastboat
4 - Shuttle
5 - DEACTIVATES

The "5" is the important part.  It will deactivate ANY S-foil functions of the craft.  For craft like the Gunboat and Missile Boat, it will allow them to fire guns in single-player, instead of displaying the "S-foils closed" message.

Changing the B-wing's "1" to a "0" didn't appear to affect anything, so I suppose, so for simplicity, use "0" to activate, and "5" to deactivate. 

Finally, if you deactivate the s-foils (on the X-wing, for example), but don't change the "start mode" line, the foils will be closed the entire mission, but weapons can still be fired from them.

=====================================
"Start Mode" line:
This is the line that determines what the "default" setting of your S-foils are.  The values here are typically the same as in the "Has Foils" line.

Setting it to "5" will have the S-foils start opened (on X-wing and B-wing).  Anything else will have them start closed.


NOTE: SETTING ANY OF THE BYTES TO A VALUE GREATER THAN "5" WILL CRASH XWA!
