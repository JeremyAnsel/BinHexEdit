This slot defines the ship type.

VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:
If you have read the comment about shield & hull
rating editing in this project, you would know
that different ship type has different way to
calculate its shield rating and hull strength.
However, the comment file is pre-assigned in the
project and thus when you change a ship's type,
say fighter to capital ship, the comment would
still be for fighter, i.e. divide by 50 to get
actual XWA value. If you follow that comment,
your shield (or hull) would be 16 times stronger
of your expected rating. Be careful.

Updated!!! Some of these will crash XWA.
Everything beyond 20 gets erroneous
names from fronttxt.txt and crashes XWA.
