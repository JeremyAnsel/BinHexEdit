Determines which slot a craft will use.  Allows for "doubling-up" of slots.  You can have two ships different point to one slot.  They will both have the same stats, but you can have them be different ship types and opts.

This is why the Modified Strike Cruiser, in the retail version, has the attributes of the Golan Two.
