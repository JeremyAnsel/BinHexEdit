Assign ship ID number to a certain species.
To enable Species 226 with Reserved Fighter 1,
input 21 in the Species 226 (DontUseMe, the slot
above Death Star II) slot, then go to Enable
Ships pattern and set 03 for Reserved Fighter 1.

* All the DontUseMe slots should be OK to add in
  whatever ship desired. The Unused Slot is a
  blank space between Species Table and the
  following data, but it seems to work out OK.

* Additional work will be to change the data in
  shiplist.txt, specdesc.txt, strings.txt, and
  spacecraft0.lst (Addressed in OPTLocation
  Pattern).

* Species 183 is assigned a ship ID# that's
  currently unknown, any further tests on it
  will be helpful.

* Species 227 is not assigned, however, in the
  shiplist.txt it is used by DSII. Any further
  test will also be helpful.
