This is an odd byte. 67 is used for all craft from X-wing to Probe Capsule. Beyond that, all sorts of numbers are used, but the only useful one is 64. Setting this byte to 64 means that you cannot target that craft type anymore. However, enemies with orders to attack you will (so when you fly as that craft, you'd better have a decoy beam). This byte is extremely useful for stealth craft.
