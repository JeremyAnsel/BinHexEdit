 The total number of 'rack', or weapon hardpoint, is stored in the 
craft's OPT file and can't be altered here in the EXE. 

  For example, TIE Defender has 8 racks: 4 lasers, 2 Ion, 2 Warhead, 
so you can input 0-7 in the rack slots, but never 8 or more.

  Also, there may be some unexpected result if the rack info in EXE
differs from the info in OPT. For example, the last two hardpoint in
TIE Defender OPT are Warhead hardpoint, but you assign rack 0 & 1 in 
EXE as Warhead rack. I didn't try it, so I don't know the consequence
of that yet. If you have any experiment and result on this, be sure
to let me know.
