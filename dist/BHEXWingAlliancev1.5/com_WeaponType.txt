"Turbo" lasers - like regular lasers but always strong no matter what the charge level is and the red and green ones make explosion sounds when fired on shields.

"Super" lasers - powerful exploding lasers capital ships fire.

Death Star II superlaser only moves if you're moving too. It looks very weird, not at all like it should.
