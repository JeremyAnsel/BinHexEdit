Example of a data comment file, "com_One Comment.txt".  Here you would enter some kind of comment that relates to valid values for the particular file you are editing.

For example, some games have certain variables that will accept only a particular set of values.  So if this what a field in your section that took Bytes, then the valid values would be 0 through 255, but maybe there are only 3 valid numbers used in the game:  110, 140 and 170.
